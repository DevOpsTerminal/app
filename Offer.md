## DevOps

Enable continuous delivery with built-in DevOps capabilities, or integrate with Jenkins or your existing DevOps toolset using DevOpsTerminal.


Todayâ€™s IT organizations need to implement DevOps best practices to bring together:
+ development,
+ testing, 
+ operations 
+ application monitoring
+ delivery.

The DevOpsTerminal acts as our app delivery hub by enabling continuous delivery with built-in DevOps capabilities,
or through integration with Jenkins, Gitlab CI or your existing DevOps toolset.

You can version, provision, and stage cloud-native apps and deploy to the cloud of your choice or on-premises. 
And you will reduce downtime with built-in monitoring and automated alerts.

## Automated Deployment Management
1-Click Deployment

The one-click deployment mechanism in DevOpsTerminal makes it easy to deploy apps from the DevOpsTerminal to one or multiple app environments.

From a deployment perspective, an app is defined as a versioned deployment package that contains all the artifacts needed to run the application.
Version Control
Version Management

The platform includes a version control system with branching and merging, allowing you to isolate development into a main line and multiple branch lines.

For example, a development team can work in the main line to develop new functionality, while another team simultaneously fixes bugs in the currently deployed app version via a branch line.

The merge capability supports multiple revisions when porting changes between lines.

### Automated testing and quality monitoring can be applied to any stage of the process.

Platform APIs allow you to integrate with Jenkins, Gitlab CI or other tools and services within your existing DevOps toolset.
Automated Testing
Automated Testing

DevOpsTerminal offers an Automated Tested Suite (ATS), a comprehensive suite of tools for creating, refactoring and automating reusable end-to-end tests based upon the user stories of your apps.

In addition, the core platform includes a test framework for unit testing and automated UI testing based on Selenium that can be easily integrated with third-party testing solutions through platform APIs.


### Multi-Cloud Deployment

Based on Cloud Foundry as well as deployable on Docker containers orchestrated by Kubernetes, DevOpsTerminal gives you the widest array of cloud deployment options available of any high-productivity aPaaS on the market.

The DevOpsTerminal low-code platform contains built-in monitoring and alerting of system faults, system performance (including hardware and network, database and Web Server performance) as well as basic application performance.

## Performance Monitor

An optional Application Performance Monitor is available to instrument apps more deeply, for example timing the execution of business logic, to provide a comprehensive, real-time, multi-dimensional view of application performance metrics.

And of course, you can integrate with any additional monitoring and management tools you may use, such as New Relic or AppDynamics through our platform APIs.


## Monitoring and Alerting

DevOpsTerminal contains built-in monitoring and alerting of system faults, system performance (including hardware and network, database and Web Server performance) as well as basic application performance.


## Log Management


Platform-level events regarding configuration, provisioning, deployment, start and stop of apps, back-up, etc. are logged with time stamp and user ID.

Application-level events like login and logout and specifically defined actions in the application model, such as calls to external systems like SAP, are also logged.


## Backup and Disaster Recovery

Your apps and data are automatically backed up either daily or on demand from your acceptance and production environments.

You can download all backups through the DevOpsTerminal. In addition, backups are stored in secure, geographically dispersed locations within your region (backup locations are in the same region to comply with local regulations).

In the rare event that a disaster strikes, your apps and data is can be easily restored in another location.
